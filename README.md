# Workouts

## Why

Since my printer ran out of ink and I couldn't print off the workout challenges,
the logical next step was to build an app. I was working on learning XSelect, and
this posed an interesting usecase for a state machine, so I figured I'd give it a whirl
in that tech stack.

## Goal

Have a site I could pull up on my phone every day to track my progress on my workout
challenges and include a time based element so that even when I copleted that day's challenge,
it will not show the next day's challenge until the next day.

Secondary goal is to keep track of multiple challenges at once so I can be crazy and
do them all at once.
